## Legend

[ ] = Not started
[x] = Won't do
[~] = Doing
[*] = Done
- ... = Note about the above item

## List

[ ] user install
	- installs ffmpeg/youtube-dl if not found ?
	- just use corresponding python libaries
[ ] detect timestamp anywhere in line (not just at start)
[x] detect tracks from missing timestamps
	- Could be done using: _ffmpeg -i audio.mp3 -af silencedetect=d=0.5 -f null -_
	but finding the right parameters for the silencedetect filter (see _man ffmpeg-filters)
	seems impossible (or very finicky) to get right for every input
    - Will possibly be added as an experimental feature later on
[ ] = GUI using pyqt
