**sya - split youtube audio**, downloads, converts & splits audio from youtube videos into multiple audio tracks.


## Overview

To work sya requires some extra work: **tracklist** information.  For more details on this, see **Tracklists** below.<br/>
The rest of the options can be configured but are provided with defaults.

Here's an overview of the options:

- **URL** - the URL of the video to fetch audio from 
- **Tracklist** - tracklist information (see below)
- **Format** - set the format to convert the audio to
- **Quality** - set the audio quality to download in, for reference 5 is equal to *128k*
- **Keep un-split file** - keep the downloaded audio file (before it gets split up)
- **Output** - the directory to download the audio track to and split it into multiple tracks

The resulting files can be found at the *Output* path on your system.


## Tracklist

A tracklist is just some text that provides the *title* and *timestamp* of the tracks.

There should be one timestamp and one title per-track (this can usually be found in the video description or a top comment).
